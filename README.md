**Improving matches from a dating site (KNN)**

My friend Hellen has been using some online dating sites to find different people to go out with. She realized that despite the site’s recommendations, she didn’t like everyone she was matched with. After some introspection, she realized there were three types of people she went out with:
✓ People she didn’t like
✓ People she liked in small doses 
✓ People she liked in large doses

After discovering this, Hellen couldn’t figure out what made a person fit into any of these categories. They all were recommended to her by the dating site. The people whom she liked in small doses were good to see Monday through Friday, but on the weekend, she’d rather spend time with the people she liked in large doses. Hellen has asked us to help her filter future matches to categorize them. In addition, Hellen has collected some data that isn’t recorded by the dating site, but she feels it’s useful in selecting people to go out with.

**1.1 Prepare: parsing data from a text file**

The data Hellen collected is in a text file called datingTestSet.txt. Hellen has been collecting this data for a while and has 1,000 entries. A new sample is on each line, and Hellen has recorded the following features:
 Number of frequent flyer miles earned per year
 Percentage of time spent playing video games
 Liters of ice cream consumed per week

Before we can use this data in our classifier, we need to change it to the format that our classifier accepts.

**1.2 Analyze: creating scatter plots with Matplotlib**

Let’s look at the data in further detail by making some scatter plots of the data from Matplotlib. This isn’t hard to do. From the Python console, type the following:

**1.3 Prepare: normalizing numeric values**

**1.4 Train classifier**

**1.5 Test: testing the classifier as a whole program**

**1.6 Use: putting together a useful system**
